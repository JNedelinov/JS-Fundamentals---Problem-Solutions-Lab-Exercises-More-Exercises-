These are all of my solutions from the JavaScript Fundamentals course at SoftUni.

The material I went through:
  1. Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements and Loops;
  2. Data Types and Variables;
  3. Arrays;
  4. Functions;
  5. Arrays Advanced;
  6. Objects and Classes;
  7. Associative Arrays;
  8. Text Processing;
  9. Regular Expressions.

Each folder contains solutions from: 
  * Lab lecture exercises;
  * Exercise lecture exercises;
  * Previous exams that I used to prepare myself for the Mid Exam and the Final Exam.
  
Some of the solutions are simpler than others.
You might notice that I have used different techniques for some exercises, just because I wanted to experiment with which style might work the best for me.

I hope I could help students from the same learning path in SoftUni as me.
